The first piece of data we are interested in collecting is the win margins of different games. A popular bet in NFL sports betting is the spread bet. This involves betting on a team to win by at least a certain amount of points, or to lose by no more than a set amount of points. The number of points a team is predicted to win by is often called the line of the game. This number is
generated by sports books based on their own
research and the amount of money placed on
both sides of the line. For example, if Team A
was favored to win by 3 points, and 80 percent of the
money was on Team A to cover the spread,
sportsbooks will often move the line to
encourage more people to bet on the side with
fewer bets, guaranteeing them more money.
This could result in the line moving to -4.5, or
Team A needs to win by 5 to cover the spread.
Many sportsbooks also allow bettors to move the
line either up or down for either raised or
lowered odds.

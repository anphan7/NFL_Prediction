1) Overall Win Margin for all teams
2) Win Margin for different spreads (0-7 point favorite) (8-14 point favorite) (14+ point favorite)
3) Win Margin for each team home and away (compare to get home field advantage)
4) Win Margin in divisional (rivalry) games compared to the spread (broken down by size of spread)

For all of above determine how often they cover

5) Teams performance against the spread in games coming off a short week. (playing Sunday then again Thursday) or (Monday -> Sunday)
6) Teams performance against the spread in games off of a long rest (bye week, Thursday - Next Sunday/Monday)
7) Win rate of individual spreads
8) Big favorite covering with low total (total below 42.5)
9) Win percentages of alt spreads at individual spread and in general
10) Win percentage of over when spread is large (>-9.5)
11) How often favorite vs underdogs cover

Stretch Goals-
7) Test how teams match up against each other (passing/rushing yards) and see what affect that has on win margin
8) Test how teams perform after big losses - narrow upset wins - long win streaks- after returning home from long road stretch. etc.
